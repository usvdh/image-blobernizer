A very simple image-blobernizer made for the webbrowser using p5.js

<!-- ![](header.png) -->

<!-- # [Live demo](https://usvdh.github.io/audio-visualizer/) -->

## Requirements

You will need to run the website on a [local server](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server).

## Usage example

By default, the audio-visualizer will play and visualize the song [Wanderlust by Jim Hall](https://www.freemusicarchive.org/music/jim-hall/synth-kid-elsewhere/wanderlust). For further enjoyment, you can upload your own songs using the upload button on the top left.
